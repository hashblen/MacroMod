# MacroMod

This is a mod that can create macroes as well as launch them, and record them. It is completely client and tick-based, so it should run even with tickrate changers or other mods.
I must warn that the code is not really good, as it is my first ever Minecraft mod or even bigger project, but I guess it still works.
Feel free to contact me about anything related to the mod, either here in issue trackers or on discord Kynatosh#2813

This mod uses and creates the macroes in the same directory as the [MpkMod](https://github.com/kurrycat2004/MpkMod), but without the annoying glitches when you have a lot of ticks. And you can record.
