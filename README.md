# MacroMod

This is a mod that can create macroes as well as launch them. It is completely client and tick-based, so it should run even with tickrate changers or other mods.
I must warn that the code is terrible, as it is my first ever Minecraft mod or even bigger project, but I guess it still works (the fields to input rotation of the camera don't work right now, I am working on it)
Feel free to contact me about anything related to the mod, either here in issue trackers or on discord Kynatosh#2813

This mod uses and creates the macroes in the same directory as the [MpkMod](https://github.com/kurrycat2004/MpkMod), but without the annoying glitches when you have a lot of ticks.
